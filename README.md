  This is very small, tiny Modbus RTU Slave library for small microcontrollers. It supports Modbus 3-6 and 16 functions!
  Easy to use, easy to port! Examples with PIC and ARM Microcontrollers! 
  
  You only need two things:
  - Communications Send/Receive Functions
  - Tick Timer Functions
 
  It's free to use with non-commercial projects.            
  
  This library was tried these MCUs:
  - All of Microchip 8-16-32bit MCUs
  - STM32F0/F1/F3/F4/G3
  - MSP430
  - Atmega Series
  - Nuvoton MCUs

  For support please give feedback for it!
  
  I also have big ModBus RTU library, Master and Slave in one file.
  If you want to use this Modbus library please contact with me.
